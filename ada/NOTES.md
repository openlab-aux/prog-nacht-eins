# Notes on Ada

Compiler `GNAT 5.3.0`

I decided to solve the first Project Euler problem, by porting a solution I'd previously written in Fortran 95.

Compilation should be possible using `gnatmake`.

I've also whipped up a simple implementation of a rather clever [Integer Square Root algorithm](http://www.nuprl.org/MathLibrary/integer_sqrt/) I found earlier today.
